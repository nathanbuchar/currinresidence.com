## About

The Currin Residence (1959) is a privately-owned, mid-century modern home in Midland, Michigan currently under restoration. The home was designed for Cedric and Betty Currin by architect [Francis E. "Red" Warner](https://francisredwarner.com/), AIA.

Warner received his architectural degree from Pennsylvania State College in 1951, after which he began working under the tutelage of Alden B. Dow, FAIA, a former Taliesen fellow and life-long friend of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Then, in 1957, he started his own architectural firm in Midland. His designs were deeply inspired by nature, and were for those who appreciated beauty without extravagance.

The Currins were one of Warner’s first clients, and their home is a shining example of mid-century modern design, featuring clean geometric lines, an emphasis on function and livability, and extensive use of natural materials such as Douglas fir, redwood, and field stone from Lake Superior. Warner also carefully considered the style and placement of the structures in order to achieve passive solar energy, and an attached greenhouse, also designed by Warner, was added in 1978.

When asked about why he contracted Red Warner to design the home, Mr. Currin replied, “I grew up in Wisconsin and had a general familiarity with Frank Lloyd Wright. I looked up architects in the Yellow Pages and saw Warner’s listing. After visiting his own home, and seeing how easy he was to work with, I decided to go with him. And I’m so glad I did!”

The Currins adored their home and lived there for the rest of their lives. Betty passed away in 2016, and three years later, at the age of 88, so did Cedric. Warner passed away in 2006, and his ashes repose among those of his friends on Midland's Dahlia Hill.

In 2020, less than a year after Cedric's passing, a catastrophic flood resulting from two upstream dam failures led to significant water ingress in the basement. The water finally began to recede after it had reached just six inches below the first floor, but not without first causing one of the concrete walls to buckle. Since then, the home has changed hands and a substantial effort to restore the home back to its original condition is underway. Thankfully, the Currin Residence will survive, but many other homes affected by the flood—some also designed by Red Warner and his colleagues—have not been as fortunate.

Nevertheless, the design and architectural details of the Currin Residence have made it a significant part of Midland’s history and a textbook example of Red Warner's ability to design affordable yet captivating homes.
