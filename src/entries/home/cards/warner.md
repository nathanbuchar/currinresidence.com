## Red Warner

_The following section has been adapted from [midcenturymidland.org](https://midcenturymidland.org/francis-red-warner/)._

Francis E. "Red" Warner was born in Big Run, Pennsylvania in 1921. He loved the outdoors. Every chance he got he would be out playing, biking, and even jumping off the railroad bridges in the Susquehanna river.

During World War II, he worked as a field engineer in the construction of naval shipyards and power houses. He received his architectural degree from Pennsylvania State College in 1951, where he was also active in many clubs and organizations including Lions Paw Honor Society and Concert Choir. From 1951 through 1957, he considered himself fortunate to be able to work under the tutelage of [Alden B. Dow](https://midcenturymidland.org/alden-b-dow/), FAIA, a student and life-long friend of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

Warner often commented that he couldn’t believe he was being paid to work in such an amazing and creative environment.

After studying under Dow for six years, in 1957 Warner started his own architectural firm in Midland. He continued working in the tradition of Alden B. Dow and Frank Lloyd Wright and was known for designing affordable, creative structures. Warner designed over fifty residences in an area extending as far as Barrington, Illinois.

Inspired by the natural beauty of nature, Warner used wood extensively. He especially liked the grain and warmth of Douglas fir beams which he incorporated in many of his designs. He always felt you didn’t have to have a lot of money to live artistically—all you needed was an appreciation for a home filled by light and views of nature. It was in the small details and practicality of his designs that he excelled. Contractors commented that they could tell it was a Red Warner home the moment they saw the front door.

Many of his homeowners were considered extended family because they became so close during the home design process, with Warner stopping in every day to oversee the build and to be sure the contractors were measuring up to his exacting standards. His success can be measured by the extent to which his clients became his best friends and admirers.

His works were honored in a gallery exhibition at the Midland Center for the Arts in 2001 along with those of Alden B. Dow and Warner's very good friend, [Jackson Hallett](https://midcenturymidland.org/jackson-hallett/), AIA.

During his career, Warner served as Director of the Michigan Society of Architects, and President of the The American Institute of Architects-Saginaw Valley Chapter. He was also an active community leader as a member of the Exchange Club, the Boy Scouts, the school district PTA, and as President of the Tri-City All-Breeds Horse Association.

After a long, active and joyful life of painting watercolors, sailing, fishing, tennis, skiing, and caring for his beloved horses, dogs and garden, Warner passed away in 2006 and his ashes now repose amongs those of his dear friends on [Dahlia Hill](https://www.michigan.org/property/dahlia-hill).
